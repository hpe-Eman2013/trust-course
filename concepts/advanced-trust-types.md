## 1. Spendthrift Trusts

**Purpose**: Prevents beneficiaries from squandering assets and protects trust property from most creditors.

**Exceptions (not protected):**
- Claims for child support or spousal support
- Federal and state tax liens
- Creditors for necessities (in some states)
- Attorneys who helped protect trust rights

**Legal Sources**:
- UTC §502–503
- Restatement (Third) of Trusts §59
- *Nichols v. Eaton*, 91 U.S. 716 (1875)

**Sample Clause**:
> “No interest of any beneficiary herein shall be assignable by voluntary act, nor shall it be subject to attachment, garnishment, execution, or other legal or equitable process.”

## 2. See-Through Trusts (IRA Beneficiary Trusts)

**Purpose**: Allows a trust to be named as an IRA beneficiary while preserving tax advantages.

**Requirements**:
- Trust must be valid under state law
- Beneficiaries must be identifiable
- Timely trust documentation to custodian

**Legal Sources**:
- IRC §401(a)(9), Treasury Reg. 1.401(a)(9)-4
- SECURE Act of 2019
- Private Letter Rulings 200403094, 200537044

**Variants**:
- Conduit Trust: Passes RMDs directly
- Accumulation Trust: Retains RMDs for later distribution

## 3. Dynasty Trusts

**Purpose**: Avoid estate taxes for multiple generations by extending the trust’s life.

**Legal Support**:
- No Rule Against Perpetuities in some states (e.g., South Dakota, Nevada)
- Michigan allows 999-year trusts (Mich. Comp. Laws §700.7402)
- GST exemptions used strategically

**Key Case**:
- *Estate of Generation-Skipping Transferor*, 97 T.C. 440 (1991)

## 4. Spousal Lifetime Access Trusts (SLATs)

**Purpose**: Allows a grantor spouse to move assets out of their estate for tax benefits, while allowing indirect access through the beneficiary spouse.

**Risks**:
- Divorce or death ends access
- Reciprocal trust doctrine if improperly structured

**Legal Sources**:
- IRC §§2503(b), 2523(e)
- *Estate of Levy v. Commissioner*, T.C. Memo 1983-453

## 5. Constructive Trusts

**Purpose**: Not a planned trust — court-imposed remedy to prevent unjust enrichment.

**Common Triggers**:
- Fraud
- Breach of fiduciary duty
- Mistake or theft

**Legal Sources**:
- Restatement (Third) of Restitution §§55–56
- *Beatty v. Guggenheim*, 122 N.E. 378 (1919)
- *Simonds v. Simonds*, 380 N.E.2d 189 (1978)
