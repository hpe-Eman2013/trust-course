<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Welcome to Part 1 of the Trust Law Course. In this session, we introduce a foundational principle in trust administration: Fiduciary Accounting Income—often abbreviated as FAI.

Fiduciary Accounting Income is not the same as taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, it is a legal accounting concept governed by state law—most notably the Uniform Principal and Income Act, or UPIA. FAI determines how income is allocated between the trust’s beneficiaries—particularly between income beneficiaries and remainder beneficiaries.

Let’s break this down.

Imagine a trust receives $10,000 in dividends and sells an investment for a $100,000 profit. The $10,000 in dividends typically qualifies as income, while the capital gain is treated as principal. This matters because income beneficiaries are entitled to receive FAI during the life of the trust, while remainder beneficiaries are entitled to the principal after the trust terminates.

Why is this important? Because the trustee’s job is to balance the interests of both groups impartially. Under Uniform Trust Code Section 803, a trustee must act fairly when managing assets and deciding how income and expenses are allocated.

Trusts are often structured with multiple parties in mind: the settlor, the trustee, income beneficiaries, and remainder beneficiaries. If the trustee misallocates income—say, treats capital gains as income without authority—the trust could trigger tax liability or even breach fiduciary duties.

To administer FAI properly, trustees rely on the UPIA, which outlines how to allocate receipts and disbursements. For example, UPIA Section 401 establishes that interest, rents, and cash dividends are allocated to income. Meanwhile, proceeds from the sale of trust assets, stock splits, and capital gains are typically allocated to principal.

Now let’s talk about how this affects taxation.

The IRS doesn’t directly care about Fiduciary Accounting Income. Instead, it looks at Distributable Net Income, or DNI. However, DNI starts with FAI—because distributions made to income beneficiaries, as defined under FAI, generally carry tax consequences. If a trust retains income, it pays tax at compressed trust rates, which reach 37% after just about $15,000 in undistributed income. By contrast, distributing income to a beneficiary in a lower tax bracket may result in a significantly lower tax burden.

Let’s consider an example.

Suppose a trust earns $50,000 in FAI. If the trustee distributes the full amount to the income beneficiary, that person pays tax at their personal income tax rate. But if the trustee retains the income, the trust itself could owe over $15,000 in tax. This illustrates the power—and complexity—of understanding FAI in conjunction with tax principles.

You may be wondering: “Why not distribute all income to avoid trust-level taxation?”

Well, sometimes the terms of the trust prohibit it. Other times, retaining income serves long-term investment goals for the remainder beneficiaries. That’s why the trustee’s role is so important—and why understanding Fiduciary Accounting Income is critical to honoring both the trust’s instructions and fiduciary law.

Let’s pause and look at the structure of a Revocable Living Trust, which is our main focus in Weeks 1 through 5.

A Revocable Trust allows the settlor—the person who creates the trust—to retain full control of the trust assets. The settlor can revoke or amend the trust at any time and often acts as both trustee and beneficiary while alive. Although the trust avoids probate and simplifies asset transfer at death, it offers no protection from creditors during the settlor’s lifetime.

In a Revocable Trust, all income is typically paid to the settlor. But after the settlor dies, the trust becomes irrevocable, and FAI starts playing a key role in how future beneficiaries receive income.

In the landmark case Estate of Rapp versus Commissioner, the IRS rejected a trust’s reclassification of income as qualified for the QTIP marital deduction because the reformation of the trust occurred in state probate court and wasn’t affirmed by the state’s highest court. The Supreme Court precedent in Commissioner v. Bosch made it clear: state court orders that affect federal tax liability are not binding unless affirmed by the state’s highest court. That’s a critical rule you’ll encounter again and again.

So, to sum up:

Fiduciary Accounting Income is legally distinct from taxable income. Trustees use state law, especially the UPIA, to allocate income and principal. Misclassifying income can lead to tax problems and breach of duty. In revocable trusts, FAI begins to matter most after the settlor passes away. Trustees must balance income and remainder interests, follow the trust’s terms, and align their actions with both legal and tax expectations.

We’ll explore these ideas further in the next segments. When you're ready, take the Part 1 quiz to test your understanding—and then move forward to Part 2.</pre>

<h2>📘 Clause Examples</h2>
<h3>1. Declaration of Trust</h3>
<blockquote>
“The Settlor hereby declares that the Trust created herein is revocable and may be altered or revoked at any time during Settlor’s life.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This clause establishes the settlor’s ongoing authority over the trust. It ensures the trust is treated as revocable under both state law and the Internal Revenue Code. Without this language, the IRS may treat the trust as irrevocable, triggering different tax treatment under IRC §§671–678.</p>
<h3>2. Trust Property Clause</h3>
<blockquote>
“The Trustee shall hold, manage, and administer all property listed in Schedule A and any subsequently transferred assets as part of the Trust Estate.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This clause confirms the trust corpus (assets) and gives the trustee legal authority to manage it. Without explicit reference to the assets, the trust may lack sufficient corpus and could be ruled unenforceable under UTC §402(a)(3).</p>
<h3>3. Beneficiaries Clause</h3>
<blockquote>
“During the lifetime of the Settlor, all net income shall be paid to the Settlor. Upon the death of the Settlor, the remainder shall be distributed to the Beneficiaries as outlined in Article Eight.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Identifying income vs. remainder beneficiaries is essential for applying UPIA rules on allocation. It also clarifies the flow of Distributable Net Income (DNI) and aligns with fiduciary accounting principles. This structure is also required to define Qualified Beneficiaries under UTC §103(13).</p>
